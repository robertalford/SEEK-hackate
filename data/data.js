I prefer late shifts, and was forced to do shift swaps in-order to get late shifts on many occasions.A third was a really bad one. It being a call center environment, staff being able to hear their phone calls is of the utmost importance. Despite this, management often played loud music, which even after being asked to turn it down or off by call center staff, often continued to play the music (they would switch it back on 20 minutes - an hour later) on a daily basis. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable behavior in a call center environment.",

Uncomfortable supervisor to staff relationships. The fact that you can have some of the staff that do the exact same job but under another employment contract with the Qantas brand receive every employment condition and benefit, definitely not good for team harmony. Over the time i have been employed, a lot of staff have been fired or retrenched which is not good for morale. Very little validation on tasks that take a lot of time and effort to complete to an exceptional standard. Apprentices that complete their 4 years are only put on for a further 18 month fixed term contract.",

Was on a contract for 12 months,  and was promised to continue the contract by store manager, but a week before it was due to be renewed they told me that I was going to be casual. Now I am struggling to make ends meet due to cut back in shifts. Aperantly that is happening all across Target stores. So casual staff are lucky to get one shift a week. How can a person live on that with a house and mortgage? Customers are complaining that there are no staff on the floor and they are right, which put more pressure on staff when they have a shift. To top that they kept on promising that I was going to be trained as supervisor and so on. It is all talk, but no delivering. No future there unless you get on a permanent part time contract.",

This is 2 weeks after everyone else of the training group had a full time buddy sitting with them and helping them with every enquiry they had and I had started that day and did not have a buddy but essentially was sitted with (despite behing 100% lovely) a very busy, occupied and unavailable person.

    "Cons": "Challenges include the somewhat bloated nature, email and the management of said communication has creates numerous roles due to huge inefficiencies. Senior management is unapproachable and permanently locked in meetings which should be delegated meaning engagement and feedback are often lost. A lot of interaction are driven by rank, as expected in a very hierarchical organization, but this means a lot of time and energy is wasted showing face. Performance and review cycles are annual and leave little room for market growth nor negotiations: you are better off leaving and returning for a higher rate than attempting to negotiate. Finally, there is a trend to hiring temporary worker's over permanent, often choosing permanent staff to take on knowledge hoarding traits to ensure job retention over facilitating a collaborative workplace.",
    "Pros": "Despite the large organization there are many opportunities for growth and development, it's namely up to the individual to seize the initiative. For those who prefer structure and rigor over innovation, the bank largely caters to a more methodical approach however there is growing dissent and investment in disruption. Direct management is very good for coaching and mentoring but the layers above and beyond tend to muddy direct communications and slow decision making. Within the digital space there is strong movement to a more iterative and customer focused value - change is a foot and will require some time to effect impacts but there is an appetite to move the bank forward dynamically over the future; very exciting.",

    "Cons": "There is a LOT of standing and manual labor, so if you need to sit down from time to time it's probably not for you. Head office can be really frustrating as they're always chopping and changing stuff on a weekly basis, so on the floor you may be setting up for a sale, but stock hasn't arrived, or they made the wrong posters and you've got to take them down, stuff like that can be challenging. Or you can have those days where it's really, really quiet. It's hard to find something to do when you've cleaned the registers, swept the floor and everything is looking immaculate! This is happening a lot at the moment because retail is in a tough financial spot at the moment. You may also find that you won't get work as a casual, or if you are fortunate that you do, it will most likely be somewhere between 3 - 5 hours a week. A friend of mine said she gets 3.5 hours a fortnight, so it is slim. Try to get a part-time position there and you'll get more hours, it's not so good for a casual because it's cheaper to keep part-timers. And if you're younger the better! Once you hit 21, they're least likely to call on you for extra shifts, unless you're a diligent, reliable and a good worker!",
    "Pros": "Excellent team to work with, and management team are flexible and very supportive. You get excellent discount rates in the store and with other stores under the Westfarmers umbrella (except for Bunnings). Depending on what store location you're in there is also a social club you can contribute to and they do raffles and competitions and if they save enough money for the year they have a pretty awesome Christmas party! My social club was fantastic but it depends on how the management team runs it, as it varies from store to store. And if you love talking to people, registers is always fun to interact with customers and you get to leave a lasting impression on customers as they leave so that's always something special. And you can start early too, youngest you can start is 15 and 9 months, only I didn't know this and I started when I was 16!",

Not the best for introverts in that sense.

The performance system is well structured now and attempts to look at your gaps and how to fix them.",

    "Cons": "The initial training for the call centre workers should involve both more product knowledge training, and more hands-on work with the actual future managers. Neglecting these can lead to surprises, and frustration down the track: For example, customers wanting more product information, and  neither you nor the manager having much of a clue as to how to help the customer properly achieve their real goals. And some call centre managers are simply incompetent.",
    "Pros": "As background, it was a contact centre environment - outbound calls mainly. It was good to have a casual wear day every Friday, and also on pay-day on Wednesday, which was fortnightly. The idea of coaching also was valuable. And most of your co-workers will tend to be friendly, understanding, even helpful.",

For example I was a pharmacy assistant and I was helping unload crates of stock off the truck to help the stockman. The job itself is alright however it is assumed that you have no knowledge so you have to get a supervisor just for cash out everytime for weeks until they think you can do it. It was a bit patronizing but I guess it would depend on the store.",

Not enough staff members usually, forced to take annual leave, always working overtime and time in lieu / overtime is never paid - regardless as to whether or not you are entitled to it.

    "Cons": "As a member of the field workforce in various roles over 35 years service, the greatest challenges revolved around giving service to the country in an industry that, by and large, was vital to the economic and social development of the community as a whole. As an individual working in a rapidly evolving technological field, the challenges related to maintaining currency with the latest technologies and systems were constant and unrelenting. These difficulties were met with resolve and persistence in order to gain the required mastery and proficiency necessary to continue working in the field. In addition to our daily activities, each of us in the field were obligated to maintain 24 hour availability when not on duty. The added stress of being required to respond to reports where there was a risk to public safety meant that we were never able to get sufficient rest in order to meet the next days challenges.The greatest challenges originated from within those parts of the organisation not directly associated with the customer-facing sections of the organisation. In addition to the inertia and restrictions placed on the field workforce by the management and administrative parts of the organisation, vested, sectional, and political interests affected the overall perceptions of how each individual in the field was regarded and treated  by the community. These perceptions tended largely to be extremely negative, and coloured the opinions and reactions of the vast majority of the population. In that period between 1990 and 2007, I was working in a part of the organisation that was highly visible and therefore extremely vulnerable to the negative and anti-social attitudes and behaviours that were exhibited by a large proportion of the general populace throughout that period of time. Virtually all of the publicity generated from outside of the organisation was negative, derogatory and disparaging of the organisation, and each incident further inflamed the situations I found myself in each and every day.The organisations' management were disinclined to offer any  explanation to counter any and all claims from any source against us , and this situation imbued most of us in the field with the belief that the work we were doing was not worthwhile or appreciated by any one person in the community.",
    "Pros": "I enjoyed the physically demanding and intellectually stimulating nature of the job in my work as a Field Technician over 35 years in various customer-facing roles. I found that working in company with groups of individuals who had the commitment to provide the best that they could to a very high standard to be both educative and inspirational. The people I worked with were open and willing to giving advice and assistance without hesitation or prejudice. While it was impossible to avoid personality conflicts all of the time, mutual respect for the individual was evident due to the knowledge, skills, capabilities, and experience that each of my colleagues possessed. I enjoyed the challenges related to the problem-solving aspects of my day-to-day work as they continued to help me learn and develop my knowledge and skills. I gained satisfaction in the belief that I was trying to make a worthwhile contribution to the country and that I was involved in an industry that contributed to the nations' prosperity.",

    "Cons": "Moving on from the registers to a new area is easy but expanding into another area from that is very difficult as the target corporation is not very inclined to spend much money on staff wages. This is a challenge because most staff end up only being trained in one or two areas (registers and another area possibly) and this makes it difficult to work at target as there are not many staff that can replace other people's shifts. Management, from my experience was also quite lacking and unsympathetic towards these problems and was also more inclined to hire young (Caucasian) Australians. There were very few staff members from different nationalities as I can only think of 1.",
    "Pros": "Working on the shop floor (hanging clothes, putting clothes away, customer liason etc) is great. Very enjoyable and quite an easy job for beginners etc. everybody starts on the registers and has the opportunity to move onto another field. The staff discount is great also as it is (I think) around 25% and applies to target as well as Kmart, coles, office works etc and the discount can be added on top of already discounted items. The pay is modest and increases by time and a half on Sundays.",

Never get paid overtime eventhough sometimes management require us to stay back. Management never satisfied with our target and achievement. Management doesnt help with problems or issues, always pass us to another people around. Manager always busy in the office eventough sometimes the branch required help. Management doesnt care about the wellbeing and happiness of staff, as it is very hard to use our annual leave and they force us to take leave whenever they wanted, so it is very hard to plan holiday with family. The branch is always understaff therefore all the staff feels under pressure by customer that complains for waiting time. Also it is very hard to get promotion, we will newd to have connections with the management or upper management to get an easy promotion, sometimes you will see people will least experience move up carreer ladder so easy because they have connections.",

    "Cons": "There is no real opportunity for advancement. \"Who you know\" not \"what you know\". As a call centre consultant the hours are long and while there is consistent talk of flexibility and work life balance, this fails to come to life when required. The work, when compared to other telephone call centres is long, complicated and as a consultant you are often unsupported by systems and management. It is seriously underpaid given the level of work involved comparatively. There is no realistic way to provide this feedback to drive change and any attempt to do so has a lasting effect on your company \"rating\" (you are no longer seen as a team player). Our call centre, to my knowledge, has in the last several months driven one person to mental breakdown with serious threats of violence against remaining staff and another staff member to attempt to throw himself out of a 6 floor window.",

    "Cons": "A lot of networks and company wisdom is informal. You need to be sponsored and connected to get things done. Sometimes it seems as if a lot more effort goes towards Selling your achievements than actually accomplishing them. There is still a strong herd mentality resulting in a fear of bold or unconventional action. Genuine leadership is rare, like diamonds in the rough. Pay is currently above average for the industry though there is concerted effort to bring it in line.  Work-life balance depends on your ambition and bargaining power. There is no work from home policy. Travel benefits are not as generous as others. You are probably better off buying commercial tickets or using your own frequent flier points. Diversity is actively encouraged during recruitment to hasten the transformation of the workforce. Good news but more needs to be done.  Beyond your immediate role, Training, mentoring and career development is squarely a personal responsibility.",
    "Pros": "Majority of staff are passionate about delivering great service. Diversity is valued with a caveat that at the end of the day, perceptions still matter. Surprisingly nimble in decision making and executing strategies for a large organisation with combination matrix and hierarchical structure.  Clubby and in some areas a family 'everyone knows everyone' culture. You can get well connected by asking for assignments and proving you can deliver. Honest mistakes are tolerated and you must persevere until you get the job done. High achievers are rewarded. A lot of work being done to foster a startup and innovation mentality at the grassroots level.  Plenty of career choices if you're based in Sydney.  The Head Office is a cocooned oasis. Management style is mostly fair and adapts to your level of competence.  Most genuinely care about your performance and make professional enough effort to overcome personal biases.  Senior executives can be openly questioned during regular town hall meetings.",

Note: the management team in my store were all Woolworths people.  All in all an atrocious and stressful workplace that had the ability to be a great workplace but stuffed up by store management and a lack of real commitment and leadership from the national executive.  Probably best to put it out of its misery when they did.  Note also that as the management of this organisation was drawn largely from Woolworths prospective employees of Woolworths would do well to read this.",
