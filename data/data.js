I prefer late shifts, and was forced to do shift swaps in-order to get late shifts on many occasions.A third was a really bad one. It being a call center environment, staff being able to hear their phone calls is of the utmost importance. Despite this, management often played loud music, which even after being asked to turn it down or off by call center staff, often continued to play the music (they would switch it back on 20 minutes - an hour later) on a daily basis. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable behavior in a call center environment.",

They are not open to new ideas or methods of delighting the customer. Telstra has the following layers:Marketing, Sales, Products, Engineering, IT, and Operations with the only group with P&L being Marketing, so therefore every other group is treated as a cost centre. Senior managers get caught in the trap of meeting KPI's to get bonuses rather than thinking holistically about the good of the company. This results on downward pressure on good individuals who are cascaded KPI's that are basically unachievable.",

Now I am struggling to make ends meet due to cut back in shifts. Aperantly that is happening all across Target stores. So casual staff are lucky to get one shift a week. How can a person live on that with a house and mortgage? Customers are complaining that there are no staff on the floor and they are right, which put more pressure on staff when they have a shift. To top that they kept on promising that I was going to be trained as supervisor and so on. It is all talk, but no delivering. No future there unless you get on a permanent part time contract.",

Senior management is unapproachable and permanently locked in meetings which should be delegated meaning engagement and feedback are often lost. A lot of interaction are driven by rank, as expected in a very hierarchical organization, but this means a lot of time and energy is wasted showing face. Performance and review cycles are annual and leave little room for market growth nor negotiations: you are better off leaving and returning for a higher rate than attempting to negotiate. Finally, there is a trend to hiring temporary worker's over permanent, often choosing permanent staff to take on knowledge hoarding traits to ensure job retention over facilitating a collaborative workplace.",
    "Pros": "Despite the large organization there are many opportunities for growth and development, it's namely up to the individual to seize the initiative. For those who prefer structure and rigor over innovation, the bank largely caters to a more methodical approach however there is growing dissent and investment in disruption. Direct management is very good for coaching and mentoring but the layers above and beyond tend to muddy direct communications and slow decision making. Within the digital space there is strong movement to a more iterative and customer focused value - change is a foot and will require some time to effect impacts but there is an appetite to move the bank forward dynamically over the future; very exciting.",

    "Cons": "There is a LOT of standing and manual labor, so if you need to sit down from time to time it's probably not for you. Head office can be really frustrating as they're always chopping and changing stuff on a weekly basis, so on the floor you may be setting up for a sale, but stock hasn't arrived, or they made the wrong posters and you've got to take them down, stuff like that can be challenging. Or you can have those days where it's really, really quiet. It's hard to find something to do when you've cleaned the registers, swept the floor and everything is looking immaculate! This is happening a lot at the moment because retail is in a tough financial spot at the moment. You may also find that you won't get work as a casual, or if you are fortunate that you do, it will most likely be somewhere between 3 - 5 hours a week. A friend of mine said she gets 3.5 hours a fortnight, so it is slim. Try to get a part-time position there and you'll get more hours, it's not so good for a casual because it's cheaper to keep part-timers. And if you're younger the better! Once you hit 21, they're least likely to call on you for extra shifts, unless you're a diligent, reliable and a good worker!",
    "Pros": "Excellent team to work with, and management team are flexible and very supportive. You get excellent discount rates in the store and with other stores under the Westfarmers umbrella (except for Bunnings). Depending on what store location you're in there is also a social club you can contribute to and they do raffles and competitions and if they save enough money for the year they have a pretty awesome Christmas party! My social club was fantastic but it depends on how the management team runs it, as it varies from store to store. And if you love talking to people, registers is always fun to interact with customers and you get to leave a lasting impression on customers as they leave so that's always something special. And you can start early too, youngest you can start is 15 and 9 months, only I didn't know this and I started when I was 16!",

    "Cons": "While Telstra is slowly transforming into a modern, dynamic company, there are still a few echoes of government ownership which pop up now and then. Lots of meetings, at least in the area I was working, sometimes got in the way and felt like they could have been replaced with a quick huddle at someone's desk.",
    "Pros": "Working in a technical team at Telstra is beyond anything I have ever experienced before. Every member of the team was extremely skilled and dedicated, which fostered an incredible atmosphere of learning and collaboration. My line manager was easily the best direct manager I've ever had, and did everything in his power to make sure that his team had everything they needed to perform at their best, as well as shielding them from external concerns. While there was a good amount of after hours work, it was all paid in full as overtime, and stand-down periods the next day meant that you could recharge your batteries and not get worn down.",

The same performance and sales targets are set for rural branches as for city branches. The NAB sales model directly contradicts their promoted 'Fair banking' for customers and does not support responsible banking and lending practices. The NAB values are folowed very loosely by some Senior Management, my People Leader put sales results before people and allowed some unethical banking practices of Managers who 'got results'.  Ancient and very cumbersome legacy IT hardware and software with minimal integration between systems.  Online knowledge resources desperately need updating, there is a mountain of information to wade through as succeeded information is not removed, and may not reflect current practice, and does not support comliance.

    "Cons": "The social culture I would say is fairly mediocre compared to other big companies. Teams are quite self contained and don't really get to know other teams so if you're in a team that doesn't get out much you're not going to socialise much unless you really branch out. Not the best for introverts in that sense. I've met some great friends here though who I fairly often see outside of work.SEEK legitimately only hire people if they're willing to challenge themselves and step outside their comfort zones. The performance system is well structured now and attempts to look at your gaps and how to fix them.",
    "Pros": "Great software development culture. All striving to do great things and everyone is accepting of everyone's strengths and weaknesses. There is a strong appetite to grow everyone's careers. Org structure is fairly flat and teams are mostly autonomous meaning we make our own product decisions and technology decisions with guidance. Great culture and people - parties are awesome. Salary and work life balance are absolutely amazing. You're able to work from home whenever you need and there is unlimited sick leave.",

    "Pros": "I was impressed with the long tenure for employees averaging at 10yrs. After speaking with majority of employees, they advised they were being paid well enough for the amount of work. Also wasn't difficult for them to travel to work due to westpac having two call centre locations. People were genuinely friendly though leadership displayed minimal value for their people. Their favourite phrase when I challenged their ways was \"it is what it is\"  therefore no vision for positive change at all. If I can sum up my experience there, I'd say people were genuinely lovely and friendly people.",

    "Cons": "As a member of the field workforce in various roles over 35 years service, the greatest challenges revolved around giving service to the country in an industry that, by and large, was vital to the economic and social development of the community as a whole. As an individual working in a rapidly evolving technological field, the challenges related to maintaining currency with the latest technologies and systems were constant and unrelenting. These difficulties were met with resolve and persistence in order to gain the required mastery and proficiency necessary to continue working in the field. In addition to our daily activities, each of us in the field were obligated to maintain 24 hour availability when not on duty. The added stress of being required to respond to reports where there was a risk to public safety meant that we were never able to get sufficient rest in order to meet the next days challenges.The greatest challenges originated from within those parts of the organisation not directly associated with the customer-facing sections of the organisation. In addition to the inertia and restrictions placed on the field workforce by the management and administrative parts of the organisation, vested, sectional, and political interests affected the overall perceptions of how each individual in the field was regarded and treated  by the community. These perceptions tended largely to be extremely negative, and coloured the opinions and reactions of the vast majority of the population. In that period between 1990 and 2007, I was working in a part of the organisation that was highly visible and therefore extremely vulnerable to the negative and anti-social attitudes and behaviours that were exhibited by a large proportion of the general populace throughout that period of time. Virtually all of the publicity generated from outside of the organisation was negative, derogatory and disparaging of the organisation, and each incident further inflamed the situations I found myself in each and every day.The organisations' management were disinclined to offer any  explanation to counter any and all claims from any source against us , and this situation imbued most of us in the field with the belief that the work we were doing was not worthwhile or appreciated by any one person in the community.",
    "Pros": "I enjoyed the physically demanding and intellectually stimulating nature of the job in my work as a Field Technician over 35 years in various customer-facing roles. I found that working in company with groups of individuals who had the commitment to provide the best that they could to a very high standard to be both educative and inspirational. The people I worked with were open and willing to giving advice and assistance without hesitation or prejudice. While it was impossible to avoid personality conflicts all of the time, mutual respect for the individual was evident due to the knowledge, skills, capabilities, and experience that each of my colleagues possessed. I enjoyed the challenges related to the problem-solving aspects of my day-to-day work as they continued to help me learn and develop my knowledge and skills. I gained satisfaction in the belief that I was trying to make a worthwhile contribution to the country and that I was involved in an industry that contributed to the nations' prosperity.",

However, I found that this 'target' system, where each employee was set a target number and to achieve their assigned target, they would need to be getting referrals or setting up services for clients. Products that held numerical rewards for points included new accounts, loans, credit cards, etc. I found this system was good in the sense it prompted employees to continually inform customers of new deals or products on offer, however, it also culminated in a lot of pressure to maintain weekly targets and essentially I felt it made a lot of employees treat customers like numbers, which defeats the focus Commonwealth Bank pushes so hard for, being number one in customer service. So I found the managers to be challenging because they only seemed to be interested in how much money or equity employees had made for the bank each day.",
    "Pros": "Training before commencing work as well as ongoing training is very useful and helps to remain up to date with products and procedures, making it easy to maintain job readiness. Salary was good and day to day work didn't get repetitive because of all the different clients and tasks that would fill in the days. Having good work colleagues was something that made the difference between the job being enjoyable as opposed to boring.",

    "Cons": "Moving on from the registers to a new area is easy but expanding into another area from that is very difficult as the target corporation is not very inclined to spend much money on staff wages. This is a challenge because most staff end up only being trained in one or two areas (registers and another area possibly) and this makes it difficult to work at target as there are not many staff that can replace other people's shifts. Management, from my experience was also quite lacking and unsympathetic towards these problems and was also more inclined to hire young (Caucasian) Australians. There were very few staff members from different nationalities as I can only think of 1.",
    "Pros": "Working on the shop floor (hanging clothes, putting clothes away, customer liason etc) is great. Very enjoyable and quite an easy job for beginners etc. everybody starts on the registers and has the opportunity to move onto another field. The staff discount is great also as it is (I think) around 25% and applies to target as well as Kmart, coles, office works etc and the discount can be added on top of already discounted items. The pay is modest and increases by time and a half on Sundays.",

It is seriously underpaid given the level of work involved comparatively. There is no realistic way to provide this feedback to drive change and any attempt to do so has a lasting effect on your company \"rating\" (you are no longer seen as a team player).
